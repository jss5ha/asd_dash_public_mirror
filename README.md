# Dash - Your Personal Dashboard

## About
Dash is a personal dashboard web application built with the Django Framework to allow you to keep track of your to-dos, courses, grades, and events.

### To-dos
Clicking on To-do on the navbar or the icon on the home page will direct you to a page where you can create a to-do for a to-do list by inputting a description, due-date, and category. It will then be sorted and displayed by category chosen, and you can click on the item when you have completed it, followed by deleting it with the "delete completed" button.

### Grades
Navigating to grades first requires you to create a course first. After creating a course, you can click on the course to navigate to that course's individual page. Here, you can toggle in the right between percentage-based grading systems and pure point-based grading systems.

For percentage-based grading systems, you must create an "Assignment Type/Category," such as "Test," "Homework," "Quizzes," etc., and give the category a weight corresponding to how much the category weighs out of the total grade. Then you submit assignments underneath each category using a dropdown, and it will automatically calculate your grade for the category and your grade overall for the course.

For point-based grading systems, you can immediately create assignments by filling out the assignment title, how many points you earned on the assignment, and the total number of points earned on the assignment.

### Events
Navigating to events will allow you to see a list view of all the events you have scheduled. You can sync up with any Google account to import up to 20 events from each selected calendar from Google Calendar associated with that account. You can also create new events by navigating using the "Create New Event" button and filling out the form.

### Calendar
Navigating to the calendar will allow you to view a calendar of the current month. You can click on the buttons on the top to see past or future months. Events will be displayed in bullets on the days they occur, and you can click these events to edit them.
